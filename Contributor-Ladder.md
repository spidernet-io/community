## Maintainer

Spiderpool was created by WeiZhou Lan, The current list of maintainers can be found in the [MAINTAINERS](https://github.com/spidernet-io/spiderpool/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md).

### An active maintainer should

* Actively participate in reviewing pull requests and incoming issues. Note that there are no hard rules on what is “active enough” and this is left up to the judgement of the current group of maintainers.

* Actively participate in discussions about design and the future of the project.

* Take responsibility for backports to appropriate branches for PRs they approve and merge.

* Do their best to follow all code, testing, and design conventions as determined by consensus among active maintainers.

* Gracefully step down from their maintainership role when they are no longer planning to actively participate in the project.

### How to be a maintainer

New maintainers are added by consensus among the current group of maintainers. This can be done via a private discussion via Slack or email. A majority of maintainers should support the addition of the new person, and no single maintainer should object to adding the new maintainer.

When adding a new maintainer, we should file a PR to [Spiderpool](https://github.com/spidernet-io/spiderpool) and update [MAINTAINERS](https://github.com/spidernet-io/spiderpool/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md). Once this PR is merged, you will become a maintainer of Spiderpool.

### Removing Maintainers

It is normal for maintainers to come and go based on their other responsibilities. Inactive maintainers may be removed if there is no expectation of ongoing participation. If a former maintainer resumes participation, they should be given quick consideration for re-adding to the team.
